## Welcome to Restaurant Manager Application.

This is an App made as part of my final Project as a Student in Coddaiseur Coding BootCamp.
This is a project made in 7 days from scratch using no templates or previous code.

## A short intro about me.

I am studing software development for 6 months now more or less and i am very pationate about creating Apps and Websites.
I have studied Orthopedic Nursing but since my early day i was working in the Hospitality business. I have managed many Restaurant's and Bars and i had my own Bar for 4 years. I am very pationate with creating music aswell and i have my own music productions, band records and even YouTube channel with my music.

## The idea behind the HorecApp and RestaurApp.

The need in the market for an easy to use PoS (Point of Sales) has never been bigger. PoS systems tend to be very complicated to use very User unfriendly and very very expensive.
I know that from experience and since now i have the tools i took the liberty to start a revolution by making a new easy to use, friendly and FREE App for small Restaurants and Bars.

‚≠ê _New technology learned during this project_

## Goals for this project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app, practicing known and exploring _new_ technologies (see above). I learned these new tools independently by reading its documentation, consultin forums like StackExchange and watching online videos.

- practice full-stack app development
- build a working prototype in 2 weeks
- apply what we learned in Codaisseur's bootcamp
- extend with new technology independently
- showcase and document development skills using:
  - wireframes as Minimum Viable Product
  - conscious data model design
  - user stories perspective
  - transparant and structured [git version control](#git-version-control)
  - use a new technology that i have learned in less than a day, Typescript.

## User stories

- As a page visitor, I can sign up and log in as a user. I must register before I can post food palettes and recipes
- As a visitor, I am able see existing food palettes and recipes as a gallery
- As a user, I am able to post new food palettes
- As a user, I am able to post new recipes
- As a visitor, I can see recipes of interest and get their details for cooking.
- As a visitor, I can select food palettes and filter for corresponding recipes
- _planned:_ As a user, I can like recipes and foodpaletes
- _planned:_ As a user, I can bookmark recipes and foodpaletes

## Welcome to Restaurant Manager Application.

This is an App made as part of my final Project as a Student in Coddaiseur Coding BootCamp.
This is a project made in 7 days from scratch using no templates or previous code.

## The idea behind the HorecApp and RestaurApp.

The need in the market for an easy to use PoS (Point of Sales) has never been bigger. PoS systems tend to be very complicated to use very User unfriendly and very very expensive.
I know that from experience and since now i have the tools i took the liberty to start a small revolution by making a new easy to use, friendly and FREE App for small Restaurants and Bars.
